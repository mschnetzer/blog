description= "This paper empirically assesses the nexus between two major wealth accumulation factors -- earned income and inheritances -- and the national net wealth position for Eurozone households. Using data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2010 and applying unconditional quantile regressions, we show that the relative importance of earned income versus inheritances varies considerably at different locations of national wealth distributions. Particularly, the significance of inheritances increases along the wealth distribution in most Eurozone countries even when controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and household composition. We also find significant country-specific differences concerning the role of earned income and inheritances for private wealth accumulation."
