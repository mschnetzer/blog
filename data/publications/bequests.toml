description= "This paper empirically compares the contribution of the two major wealth accumulation factors - earned income and inheritances - to the net wealth position of households in the Eurozone. Using unconditional quantile regressions, we show that the elasticities of both wealth sources differ considerably across countries and are overly non-linear. Depending on the position in the wealth distribution, an additional percentile in the income distribution corresponds to a 0.1-0.5 percentile increase in the net wealth distribution. We find these effects to be substantially stronger for inheritances vis-รก-vis income from employment. In the bottom decile, households have to climb less than two percentiles in the income distribution to compensate a one percentile increase in the inheritance distribution, whereas this ratio surges to almost four percentiles at the top of the wealth distribution."
