description= "This paper assesses the role of earned income and inheritances for household wealth accumulation in the Eurozone. We use data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) and apply unconditional quantile regressions with a set of sociodemographic covariates and controls for between--country differences in household composition. Our findings suggest that inheritances gain in importance along the wealth distribution in most countries. On average, the receipt of inheritance corresponds to an increase of 40 percentiles in the national income distribution. Contrasting country-specific estimates with the Eurozone average, we identify significant differences in the relative importance of earned income and inheritances for wealth accumulation across countries."
