description= "This paper investigates the gap in property income between household survey data and national accounts. We show that coverage ratios of property income in EU-SILC and HFCS are well below those typically found for other income components and evalu- ate multiple strategies to scale survey data up to the national accounts aggregates. We evaluate how different imputation strategies and assumptions on rates of return affect the distribution of property incomes in Eurozone countries. The results suggest that subjective choices during data processing have a strong effect on reported income in- equality measures. Conditional on the method used, inequality can change by up to 60 Gini points in case of the marginal distribution of property income and by more than 5 Gini points for gross total household income."
