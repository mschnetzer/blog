description= "Rising current account imbalances around the globe preceded the Great Recession in the late 2000s. These imbalances narrowed significantly during the crisis mainly due to a negative demand shock and plummeting imports in deficit countries. While income inequality and household debt played a pivotal role in current account imbal- ances prior to the crisis, it is unclear whether these relations still hold when including the post-crisis era. We estimate current account determinants using a panel of 31 OECD countries over 45 years and include measures for functional and personal in- come distribution as well as household debt. We find a sustained relation between income inequality and current accounts when including the post-crisis period, whereas the link to household debt diminishes. Thus, policies addressing macroeconomic im- balances should comprise income inequality and monitor levels of household debt."
