description= "This paper provides firstâ€“time insights into the socioeconomic specifics of the Austrian wealth distribution. Based on data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2010, we explore patterns of household characteristics associated with the wealth dispersion. Due to the pronounced nonlinear relationship of wealth, we incorporate the complex survey design in quantile regressions to analyze the joint distribution of specific attributes and households net wealth position. Our findings emphasize the role of age, education, the ownership of a main residence and company stakes in order to identify generic households across the distribution. Looking at the top, the results indicate a specific role of being self-employed or having received inheritances."
