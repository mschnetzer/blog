description= "Vienna is widely acknowledged as one of the most livable cities with little social disparities and a unique model of public housing. In contrast to other European cities, public housing spreads across low- and high-income areas, aiming to promote the social mix in the neighborhood. This paper analyzes neighborhood income inequality with administrative wage tax data on a small-scale raster grid of 500Ã—500 meter. We find distinct spatial patterns of income and inequality and study their nexus with public housing. The results suggest that public housing in Vienna is not associated with income segregation but rather correlates with a higher social mix in the neighborhood."
