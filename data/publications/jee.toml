description= "After a long period of profound skepticism, academia has started to embrace the role of Wikipedia as the world’s largest hub of knowledge. While researchers use the online encyclopedia as a popular resource and a tool to communicate scientific progress to the general public, Wikipedia’s potential as an instrument in academic teaching has not entirely been realized. Against this backdrop, we provide theoretical considerations and practical guidance for setting up a postgraduate economics course where students disseminate research on income inequality to a greater audience, which proves to have a lasting impact on student motivation. Moreover, we emphasize the benefits of the reciprocal feedback options and collaborative editing inherent in Wikipedia."
