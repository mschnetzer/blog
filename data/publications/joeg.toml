description= "Vienna is widely acknowledged as one of the most livable cities with little social disparities and a unique model of public housing. However, empirical research on small-scale inequality and its relation to public housing is scarce. This paper analyzes neighborhood income inequality with novel wage tax data on a 500x500 meter raster grid. We find spatial patterns of income and inequality indicating social mixing in Vienna. Spatial econometric models suggest that public housing, while being linked to lower income areas, rather promotes than weakens the social mix within a neighborhood."
