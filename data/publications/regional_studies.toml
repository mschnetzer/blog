description= "This paper analyses the relationship between regional inequality and average income in a small-scale framework for Austria. The empirical findings are based on a novel inequality database generated from individual wage tax information at the municipality level. This study researches the magnitude of regional spillovers of income and inequality using spatial econometric methods. The results show a pronounced positive relation between regional income levels and inequality, where especially high-income municipalities exhibit a large spread in the income distribution. Furthermore, it shows that higher levels of inequality are associated with income gains at the top of the distribution."
