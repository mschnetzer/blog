description= "This paper presents an outline for an undergraduate course on wealth inequality with nine learning goals. Based on empirical evidence from the Eurozone Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), wealth inequality is introduced as a distinct field of study. Working with HFCS data ensures that instructors gain insights into the problems of empirical wealth research for discussions with their students. By reference to the latest literature, this article addresses the challenges of collecting wealth data and measuring wealth inequality. Special attention is devoted to inheritances, since wealth transfers turn out to be a decisive trigger for wealth inequality. Finally, the paper presents new online tools as support for interactive teaching in class."
