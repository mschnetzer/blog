description= "This paper presents an outline for an undergraduate course on wealth inequality with nine learning goals. Based on empirical evidence from the Eurozone Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2010 (HFCS), wealth inequality is introduced as a distinct field of study. The outline concisely illustrates the challenges of empirical research when collecting wealth data and measuring wealth inequality. By reference to recent literature, particular attention is paid to intergenerational wealth transfers. Finally, the paper presents several tools for interactive teaching."
